# IBM HR Employee Attrition Predictor
## Dataset: IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset
## Problem description: 
 Employee attrition is a critical issue faced by organizations
 globally, impacting productivity, morale, and the overall cost of recruitment and training.
 High attrition rates can lead to skill gaps, reduced team cohesion, and increased
 operational expenses. Understanding the factors contributing to attrition, such as job
 dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities, and work-life balance challenges, is
 essential for developing effective retention strategies.
 The objective of the project would be identifying methods to increase employee
 retention, to directly address the attrition problem by identifying the reasons for attrition.
 Therefore identifying employees that are likely to quit and taking related actions to
 entice employees to stay.
## Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Decision Trees, Association and Clustering
## Result and Justification

 Taking into account accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, the logistic
 regression model outperformed the neural network in all aspects. Where the
 model is important in identifying the cases correctly, it is however unable to give a
 good enough prediction for the employees that are likely to quit. High false
 positive rate, on an already small percentage of testing data would lead to
 irrelevant results when identifying actual employees that may want to quit. The
 decision tree was also outperformed by the logistic regression model, and hence
 the final choice was to proceed with the logistic regression modelâ€™s insights to
 determine the methods to address employee attrition
